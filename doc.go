// Package deque contains a generics-enabled deque implementation.
//
// The implementation is a modified version of
// https://github.com/gammazero/deque. Through the integration of
// https://github.com/cheekybits/genny, concrete implementations for most data
// types can be generated.
//
// See the repository https://github.com/pskopnik/genny-deque for information on
// how to integrate this into your code base.
